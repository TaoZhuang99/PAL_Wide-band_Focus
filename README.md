# PAL_Wide-band_Focus

This demo showcases the sound reproduction effect of a 576-channel wide-band focusing PAL array. 

- "Experiment_setup.pdf" shows the PAL prototype and the experimental setup.

- "PAL_WideBandFocus_Demo_Axial.mp4" demonstrates the sound reproduction effect when microphone moves along the **axial** direction, while "origin_music_Axial.wav" contains the original audio file of the music segment from "PAL_WideBandFocus_Demo_Axial.mp4".

- "PAL_WideBandFocus_Demo_Transverse.mp4" demonstrates the sound reproduction effect when microphone moves along the **transverse** direction, and "origin_music_Axial.wav" contains the original audio file of the music segment from "PAL_WideBandFocus_Demo_Transverse.mp4".

- Both demo videos highlight the characteristics of **high resolution** and **high contrast** of the wide-band focusing PAL in sound reproduction.
